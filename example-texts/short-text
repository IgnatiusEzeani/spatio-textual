It was the spring of 1943 when they came for us. We were living in a small village near Krakow. The soldiers arrived early in the morning, shouting. They rounded everyone up and forced us onto crowded trains. The journey was terrible, days and nights without food or water. We didn't know where we were going, but the fear was palpable.
