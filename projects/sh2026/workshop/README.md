# SH2026 Full-Day Colab Workshop

Official title: **AI and NLP for Spatial Humanities: From Manual Annotation to LLM-Assisted Interpretation**

Keynote companion: **From Coordinates to Context: Rethinking Spatial Humanities in the Age of Large Language Models**

## Teaching philosophy

This is not a package walkthrough and not an argument that newer methods simply replace older ones. Participants should understand what each methodological family can and cannot represent, then use `spatio-textual` as the shared implementation environment.

The workshop follows one repeated pattern:

`source text -> method -> output -> error/disagreement -> validation -> interpretation`

Across the day, the methodological sequence is:

`manual annotation -> rules/gazetteers -> contextual NLP -> entity resolution -> affect/events -> evidence-first LLM extraction -> adjudication -> mapping -> responsible Spatial AI`

Every notebook should run independently after setup and should contain or point to a fallback path for heavyweight/API-dependent sections.

## Audience assumptions

- Spatial/Digital Humanities researchers;
- mixed coding experience;
- Python familiarity helpful but not required;
- no assumption of GPU access;
- no requirement for paid LLM API keys.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the day, participants should be able to:

1. explain why spatial information in text extends beyond named mappable places;
2. manually define and annotate a small spatial-information task;
3. compare rule/gazetteer, spaCy and transformer NER approaches;
4. distinguish recognition, resolution, relation and interpretation;
5. inspect ambiguity and model disagreement rather than hiding them;
6. compare rule, HF and LLM-capable affect pipelines critically;
7. understand schema-constrained LLM extraction and evidence requirements;
8. construct and inspect structured journey records;
9. record human accept/edit/reject decisions in an auditable way;
10. export auditable annotations to JSONL/CSV/GeoJSON;
11. explain why some spatial evidence should not be forced onto a point map;
12. document provenance, uncertainty, model drift and data-governance constraints.

**Important:** “Implemented” means the notebook content and code path exist. It does not by itself mean a fresh manual Google Colab rehearsal has been completed for the final release candidate.

## Notebook sequence and teaching messages

### 00 · Setup and orientation — 30 min

Introduce location, locale and sense of place; install the SH2026 branch; load public-safe teaching examples; introduce the common audit schema; and show the end-to-end destination.

**Message:** spatial information in text is broader than named coordinates.

### 01 · Manual annotation — 35 min

Annotate places, geo-nouns, relations, distance/time and subjective descriptors; compare participant judgements with a documented reference; expose span, ontology and selection disagreement.

**Message:** human annotation is interpretive too.

### 02 · Rules and gazetteers — 45 min

Use bounded gazetteers/project resources, a deterministic EntityRuler/regex baseline, transparent failure analysis and latency/coverage measurements.

**Message:** transparent and reproducible does not mean complete.

### 03 · Contextual NER — 55 min

Separate contextual spaCy NER from spaCy + project resources; compare a revision-pinned HF NER condition through either the default precomputed teaching fallback or the optional live heavyweight route; harmonise labels; distinguish within-ontology accuracy from representational reach.

**Message:** context helps, but the training ontology still constrains what the model can see.

### 04 · Linking, ambiguity and historical geography — 40 min

Separate NER from entity resolution; inspect offline `GeoResolver` output, candidate ambiguity and historical polities; append human review rather than silently overwriting model output.

**Message:** a coordinate is an interpretation, not simply an annotation.

### 05 · Affect and narrator-centred events — 50 min

Compare sentiment/emotion rule baselines with a revision-pinned transformer condition, using a genuine precomputed teaching fallback on the default route and the same pinned models on the optional live route; inspect lexical cues and domain assumptions; and examine narrator-centred movement/action events.

**Message:** model-labelled affect is an analytical signal, not psychological ground truth.

### 06 · Evidence-first LLM structured extraction — 60 min

Inspect the journey JSON contract, require verbatim source evidence, compute offsets locally, distinguish `explicit`, `contextual_inference` and `missing`, expose unsupported/schema-invalid output, and optionally make a live provider call. The default path already uses deterministic teaching clients and therefore does not require an API key or pretend that a simulated response is empirical LLM evidence.

**Message:** the useful LLM pattern is constrained extraction + evidence + validation, not fluent generation.

### 07 · Compare, disagree and adjudicate — 45 min

Use model voting without erasing disagreement; accept/edit/reject review events; compare review burden with correction burden; and construct tidy comparison tables.

**Message:** there is no single method winner across all dimensions.

### 08 · From text to map — 35–45 min

Create point and journey GeoJSON, inspect route audits, build a Folium map, compare textual nearness with Euclidean distance, and retain spatial evidence that should not be forced onto a point map.

**Message:** mapping is one possible representation of spatial evidence, not its endpoint.

### 09 · Responsible Spatial AI — 20–30 min

Inspect provenance, uncertainty, data governance, model/provider drift and the release checklist.

**Message:** the more interpretive power delegated to AI, the stronger the audit trail must become.

## Proposed day schedule

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 09:30-10:00 | Setup and conceptual framing |
| 10:00-10:35 | Manual annotation |
| 10:35-11:20 | Rules and gazetteers |
| 11:20-11:35 | Break |
| 11:35-12:30 | Contextual NER |
| 12:30-13:10 | Linking and ambiguity |
| 13:10-14:00 | Lunch |
| 14:00-14:50 | Affect and events |
| 14:50-15:50 | LLM structured extraction |
| 15:50-16:05 | Break |
| 16:05-16:50 | Compare and adjudicate |
| 16:50-17:25 | Text to map |
| 17:25-17:45 | Responsible Spatial AI + wrap-up |

The schedule is deliberately modular. If earlier discussion runs long, Notebook 09 can be used as a concise closing checklist and parts of Notebook 08 can be demonstrated rather than completed hands-on.

## Teaching datasets

**Primary:** Lake District examples that can be distributed under their source terms, for named places, geo-nouns, landscape descriptors, textual nearness and map comparison.

**Secondary:** instructor-created public-safe oral-history/travel examples with Q/A structure, movement, ambiguity, affect and missing fields.

**Research demonstration only:** controlled-access Holocaust testimony results should be represented through aggregate statistics, diagrams, schemas and cleared/precomputed material where permitted. Do **not** bundle controlled transcripts in the public notebooks or repository.

## Shared outputs

Notebooks write under:

```text
sh2026_outputs/
  annotations/
  comparisons/
  geojson/
  figures/
  human_review/
```

Outputs should follow `projects/sh2026/docs/COMMON_SCHEMA.md` so selected tables and figures can be reused directly in the hosted demo and keynote.

## Reliability and release gates

Every release candidate must:

- execute all ten default notebook paths on CPU without participant API keys;
- provide a documented fallback for heavyweight/API-dependent sections;
- be safe to re-run from the top without leaking credentials;
- record model/backend/version information for empirical outputs;
- preserve public-safe data boundaries;
- pass the current-head automated smoke suite;
- pass at least one fresh manual Google Colab rehearsal.

The operational go/no-go checklist is `projects/sh2026/docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Instructor and fallback package

`INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md` provides the delivery sequence, troubleshooting guidance, no-network/no-API routes and 5-minute/15-minute contingencies. The fallback package is now explicit and provenance-indexed in `projects/sh2026/demo/fallback_manifest_v1.json`:

- `fallback_journeys_v1.json`: instructor-curated journey examples for schema/evidence/review teaching, not model predictions;
- `ner_transformer_teaching_fallback_v1.json`: real revision-pinned Hugging Face NER output for Notebook 03;
- `affect_transformer_teaching_fallback_v1.json`: real revision-pinned transformer affect output for Notebook 05.

Notebook 06 already has a deterministic no-API teaching client, so we do **not** manufacture a fake LLM fallback simply to populate the package. A future retained live-LLM output should be added only if it is genuinely needed and provenance-complete.

## Current implementation block

1. Keep a stable current head and allow the full CI suite, especially `SH2026 Colab notebook smoke`, to finish.
2. Use `projects/sh2026/benchmarks/results_snapshot_v1.json` as the single reportable metric feed for the conference demo/keynote; fallback files are teaching/reliability assets, not benchmark substitutes.
3. Run one fresh manual Google Colab rehearsal of all ten notebooks from the release candidate and record it in the release checklist.
4. Rehearse the hosted Streamlit demo from a clean/private browser with no API key, then optionally with server-side live LLM access.
5. Capture the presentation contingency package: local critical notebooks/figures plus screenshots or a short recorded demo walkthrough.
6. Freeze the RC identity/tag only after those gates pass.

The workshop core and the heavyweight teaching fallback package are structurally complete. The remaining work is release validation and presentation rehearsal, not further notebook construction.
