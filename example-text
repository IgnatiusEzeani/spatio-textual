It was the spring of 1943 when they came for us. We were living in a small village near Krakow. The soldiers arrived early in the morning, shouting. They rounded everyone up and forced us onto crowded trains. The journey was terrible, days and nights without food or water. We didn't know where we were going, but the fear was palpable.

Finally, we arrived at a place with barbed wire fences and watchtowers. It was Auschwitz. The separation was immediate. Men to one side, women and children to the other. I never saw my father again. My mother and I were sent to the women's camp. The conditions were horrific. Overcrowding, starvation, disease. We were forced to do hard labor, building roads and clearing rubble.

One day, my mother became very ill. I tried to care for her, but there was nothing I could do. She died a few weeks later. I was alone. The days blurred into weeks, weeks into months. The constant threat of death was always present. Selections were frequent, and those deemed too weak to work were sent to the gas chambers. I don't know how I survived. Maybe it was luck, maybe it was sheer will. The memories are still vivid, even after all these years. The hunger, the cold, the constant fear, the loss of everything I ever knew. It's a burden I carry every day.
